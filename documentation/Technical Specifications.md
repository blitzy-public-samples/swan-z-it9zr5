    }

    STYLE_PROFILES {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        jsonb quiz_responses
    }

    STYLE_PREFERENCES {
        uuid id PK
        uuid style_profile_id FK
        uuid style_line_id FK
        int preference_score
    }
```

### Non-Relational Database (MongoDB)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Custom Designs] -->|Contains| B[design_id]
    A -->|Contains| C[user_id]
    A -->|Contains| D[product_id]
    A -->|Contains| E[design_parameters]

    G -->|Contains| I[input_parameters]
    G -->|Contains| J[output_data]
    G -->|Contains| K[created_at]
```

### Caching Layer (Redis)

- User sessions
- Frequently accessed product information
- AI model prediction results

## API DESIGN

The Swan-Z Style App will use a RESTful API design for communication between the mobile app and backend services. Here's an overview of the main API endpoints:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Gateway] --> B[/auth]
    A --> C[/users]
    A --> D[/products]
    A --> E[/orders]
    A --> F[/designs]
    A --> G[/ai]

    B --> B1[POST /login]
    B --> B2[POST /register]
    B --> B3[POST /logout]

    C --> C1[GET /profile]
    C --> C2[PUT /profile]
    C --> C3[POST /style-quiz]

    D --> D1[GET /list]
    D --> D2[GET /{id}]
    D --> D3[GET /recommendations]

    E --> E1[POST /create]
    E --> E2[GET /{id}]
    E --> E3[GET /history]

    F --> F1[POST /generate]
    F --> F2[GET /{id}]
    F --> F3[PUT /{id}]

    G --> G1[POST /style-match]
    G --> G2[POST /design-generate]
```

All API endpoints will:
- Use JWT for authentication
