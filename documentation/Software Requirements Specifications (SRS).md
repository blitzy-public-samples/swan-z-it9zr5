```

## DATA STORAGE

The Swan-Z Style App will utilize a combination of relational and non-relational databases to efficiently store and retrieve data:

1. **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL will be used to store structured data such as user profiles, orders, and product information. This ensures data integrity and supports complex queries.

2. **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB will be used to store unstructured data such as custom design parameters and AI model outputs. This allows for flexibility in data schema and faster read/write operations for large datasets.

3. **In-Memory Cache**: Redis will be used to cache frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and popular product information, to reduce database load and improve response times.

### Data Retention

- User account data will be retained indefinitely, or until the user requests account deletion.
- Order history will be retained for 7 years to comply with financial regulations.
- Custom designs will be retained for 1 year after creation, unless explicitly saved by the user.
- AI model training data will be anonymized and retained indefinitely for continuous improvement.

### Redundancy and Backup

- All databases will be configured with multi-region replication to ensure high availability.
- Daily incremental backups and weekly full backups will be performed for all databases.
- Backups will be stored in a separate cloud storage service with encryption at rest.
- A disaster recovery plan will be implemented with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 15 minutes.

### Scalability

- Database sharding will be implemented for the PostgreSQL database to handle increased load as the user base grows.
- MongoDB will be deployed in a sharded cluster configuration to distribute data across multiple servers.
- Auto-scaling policies will be set up for both database and application servers to handle traffic spikes.

## DATA PROCESSING

The Swan-Z Style App will process data through various components of the system. The following data flow diagram illustrates the high-level data processing within the application:

   - Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to manage user permissions.

3. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Personal identifiable information (PII) will be anonymized when used for AI model training.

4. **API Security**:
   - API rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse.
   - Input validation and sanitization will be performed on all API endpoints.

5. **Audit Logging**:
   - All data access and modifications will be logged for auditing purposes.
   - Logs will be stored securely and retained for 1 year.

6. **Compliance**:
   - GDPR and CCPA compliance will be ensured through data minimization, user consent management, and data portability features.

7. **Third-party Integrations**:
   - All third-party services will be vetted for security compliance.
   - Data sharing with third parties will be limited to essential information only.

By implementing these data requirements, the Swan-Z Style App will ensure efficient data management, scalability, and security while providing a seamless user experience and supporting the AI-driven personalization features.

   - Port: 587 (submission) or 465 (SMTPS)

5. OAuth 2.0:
   - Purpose: Authentication and authorization for social media integrations
   - Protocol: As specified by OAuth 2.0 standards

6. CDN:
   - Purpose: Efficient delivery of static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
   - Protocol: HTTPS
   - Provider: To be determined (e.g., Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront)

Data Formats:

1. JSON: Primary data format for API requests and responses
2. Protocol Buffers: For efficient binary serialization in performance-critical components
3. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication and session management
4. SVG: For scalable graphics and icons
5. PNG/JPEG: For raster images and product photos

All communication interfaces will implement appropriate security measures, including:

- TLS encryption for all data in transit
- Certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks

These communication interfaces ensure secure, efficient, and standardized data exchange between the Swan-Z Style App and its various external components and services.
